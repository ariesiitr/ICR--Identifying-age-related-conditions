# Identifying Age-Related Conditions (ICR)

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to identify age-related conditions using a dataset provided for the "ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions" competition on Kaggle. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building to predict the target variable related to age-related conditions.

## Data Description

The dataset contains various features, including medical and demographic information. Key columns include:
- `Id`: Unique identifier for each entry.
- `target`: The target variable indicating the presence of an age-related condition.
- Multiple numerical and categorical features representing patient data.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Loading Data**: The data is loaded from CSV files.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are addressed by imputation or removal.
3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables are encoded using techniques like one-hot encoding.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Visualization**: Histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices are used to understand data distribution and relationships.
- **Summary Statistics**: Descriptive statistics provide insights into the central tendency and variability of features.

### Feature Engineering

- **Scaling**: Numerical features are standardized to ensure uniformity.
- **Interaction Features**: New features are created based on interactions between existing features to capture complex relationships.

### Model Building

1. **Model Selection**: Various models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, are evaluated.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search and cross-validation are used to optimize model parameters.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Results

- **Model Performance**: The performance of different models is compared, and the best-performing model is selected.
- **Feature Importance**: Key features contributing to the model's predictions are identified.

### Visualizations

- **ROC Curves**: Receiver Operating Characteristic curves to evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualization of the confusion matrix to understand the classification performance.

## Conclusion

The project successfully identifies the most significant features and builds a predictive model for age-related conditions.
